The syntax of the `if` statement in Java is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. Hereâ€™s the basic syntax for the `if` statement:

Basic `if` Statement

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

- **condition**: An expression that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- **Code block**: A block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` that will be executed if the condition is `true`.

Example-

```java
int number = 10;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
}
```

In this example, the condition `number > 0` is evaluated. Since `number` is 10 (which is greater than 0), the code inside the `if` block executes, and "The number is positive." is printed.

`if-else` Statement

If you want to execute different code blocks based on whether the condition is `true` or `false`, you use the `if-else` statement:

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

Example

```java
int number = -5;

if (number > 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is positive.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is non-positive.");
}
```

In this example, since `number` is -5 (which is not greater than 0), the code inside the `else` block executes, and "The number is non-positive." is printed.
