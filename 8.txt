The `for` loop and `do-while` loop in Java are both used for iteration, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Here’s a comparison between them:

1. Initialization and Condition Checking

- `for` Loop:
  - Initialization: Performed once at the beginning of the loop.
  - Condition Checking: Checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is false from the start, the loop body might not execute at all.

  Example:
  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
  }
  ```

- `do-while` Loop:
  - Initialization: Initialization is done outside the loop, similar to the `for` loop.
  - Condition Checking: Checked after each iteration of the loop. The loop body always executes at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

  Example:
  ```java
  int i = 0;
  do {
      System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
      i++;
  } while (i < 5);
  ```

2. Execution Guarantee

- **`for` Loop**: 
  - The loop body may not execute if the initial condition is false. It’s ideal when the number of iterations is known or can be determined in advance.

- **`do-while` Loop**: 
  - The loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once. It’s suitable when you want the loop to run at least once regardless of the initial condition.

3. Use Cases

- **`for` Loop**:
  - Used when you know beforehand how many times you need to iterate.
  - Commonly used for iterating over arrays or collections with known sizes.

- **`do-while` Loop**:
  - Used when you need to ensure that the loop body runs at least once before checking the condition.
  - Suitable for scenarios where the condition to continue iterating might depend on the loop execution itself.
