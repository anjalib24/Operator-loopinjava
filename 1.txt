In Java, the conditional (ternary) operator is a concise way to perform conditional logic. It has the following format:


condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression


- condition: An expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- trueExpression: The value or expression that is evaluated and returned if the condition is `true`.
- falseExpression: The value or expression that is evaluated and returned if the condition is `false`.

Example:


public class ConditionalOperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        
        // Using the ternary operator to find the maximum of a and b
        int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

        System.out.println("The maximum value is: " + max); // Output: The maximum value is: 20
    }
}


In this example:
- (a > b) is the condition.
- `a` is the `trueExpression`, and `b` is the `falseExpression`.
- If `a > b` is `true`, `max` will be `a`; otherwise, `max` will be `b`.
